# Drainage Take Off

Taking off drainage involves detailing each individual run, measuring from the drawing then calculating the length of run at each depth range.
This process can often be long and tedious to type out manually.

This sheet has one entry page:

Entering all the required information will result in the depths and materials pages automatically being populated:

## Manholes
To Further speed things along a second data entry page was added to enter the manhole schedule.  This will automatically enter the depths of manholes and simplifies re-entry should there be a need for any to be changed:

## Quick Total
One of the main features of this calculator is you don't have to manually create a total row, quite simply if either **From** or **To** contain the word *Total* it will automatically total all items since the last total.

## Materials
To save performing the same take off for materials if you set the correct *Product Material* at entry then the number of pipes, rockers are calculated.  If the correct **Type** is selected for each connection it will also calculate the junctions, gullies etc. as defined on the Settings page.

**Note that bends must be entered manually**
