#Drainage Take Off

Taking off drainage involves detailing each individual run, measuring from the drawing then calculating the length of run at each depth range.
This process can often be long and tedious to type out manually.

This sheet has one entry page:

## Manholes
To Further speed things along a second data entry page was added to enter the manhole schedule.  This will automatically enter the depths of manholes and simplifies re-entry should there be a need for any to be changed:
